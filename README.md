Network Config Sorting tool 2.0 
(Only router sort works for now)

1) Go into \Network Diff\Network Diff\bin\Debug\
2) Run Network Diff.exe
3) Drag your folders into the path input/search for them (one at a time can be done or both)
4) Click sort
5) Folders are created with all bootcfgs and overrides for TNCT and LIVE
6) Use Winmerge or Beyond Compare to compare the TNCT bootcfgs and Live bootcfgs
